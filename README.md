# MusicBrainz Userscripts

A collection of userscripts for MusicBrainz.

[Dedicated support thread](https://community.metabrainz.org/t/768583/)

## Disclaimer

These scripts were created with the help of Google Gemini. While they are functional, they may not always be perfect. I am not a developer, so my ability to fix complex issues is limited. Please report any bugs or issues, and I will do my best to address them.

## Installing

To use these userscripts, you need a [userscript manager extension](https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Guides/Userscripts#Userscript_manager) for your browser, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

## Userscripts

Most of the scripts are also available on [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1473430-chaban).
